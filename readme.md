# Kamma Test (part 1)
<p>Create this simple web page layout to the best standards you know:</p>

## How to run
<p>Run this command in the root of the project:</p>

```console
$ npm install
```

And then

```console
$ npm run dev
```

## Testing
<p>
You can check the site from your mobile using the network url.
</p>

## Notes

<p>

Using [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/routing) 
to generate your Vue projects makes the process super quick
</p>

## Considerations

<p>

Wanted to build the second part of the test within this view but realised that
I would need a back end site a front end site and probably a docker container to automate the process, 
making the test too long. 
</p>

<p>
 If I were to build a site now I would probably work with a simple Vue SPA,
and multiple services in Laravel.</p>
